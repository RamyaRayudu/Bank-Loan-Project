# 💰 Bank Loan Project (Power BI + SQL + Python)

This project explores and visualizes key trends in bank loan data to uncover insights related to loan amounts, customer verification status, loan grades, and payment behaviors.

## 📌 Objective

The main goal of this project was to analyze bank loan performance using historical lending data. It focuses on:

- 📈 **Year-wise Loan Amount Statistics**
- 🏷️ **Grade and Sub-grade wise Revolving Balance (revol_bal)**
- ✅ **Comparison of Total Payments: Verified vs Non-Verified Status**
- 🗺️ **State-wise and Month-wise Loan Status Distribution**
- 🏠 **Home Ownership vs Last Payment Date Analysis**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- 📊 **Power BI** – Data visualization and interactive dashboards
- 🐍 **Python (Pandas)** – Data preprocessing and transformation
- 🗃️ **SQL** – Data extraction and aggregation

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Type:** Personal dataset  
- **Source:** Not publicly available 
- Contains 39,000+ records of loan applications and financial metrics.

--

## 💡 Key Insights

- 📈 **Loan amounts** increased steadily from 2007 to 2011, indicating growing lending volume.
- 🏷️ Sub-grades **A1 to C5** have fairly consistent revolving balances across the board.
- ✅ Verified, source-verified, and non-verified statuses all have an equal share in total payment distribution.
- 🌍 **State-wise monthly loan status** revealed frequent defaults in certain months.
- 🏠 All categories of **home ownership** show nearly equal distribution of last payment dates, suggesting ownership doesn't significantly influence timely payments.
