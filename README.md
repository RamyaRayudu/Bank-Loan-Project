# 💳 Bank Loan Project (Power BI + SQL + Python)

## 📌 Objective

The main goal of this project was to analyze bank loan performance using historical lending data. It focuses on:
- Year-wise loan amount trends
- Revolving balance by loan grade and sub-grade
- Total payments by verification status
- State-wise and month-wise loan status distribution
- Home ownership versus last payment dates

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- 📊 **Power BI** – Data visualization and interactive dashboards
- 🐍 **Python (Pandas)** – Data preprocessing and transformation
- 🗃️ **SQL** – Data extraction and aggregation

---

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Contains 39,000+ records of loan applications and financial metrics.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- 📈 **Loan amounts** increased steadily from 2007 to 2011, indicating growing lending volume.
- 🏷️ Sub-grades **A1 to C5** have fairly consistent revolving balances across the board.
- ✅ Verified, source-verified, and non-verified statuses all have an equal share in total payment distribution.
- 🌍 **State-wise monthly loan status** revealed frequent defaults in certain months.
- 🏠 All categories of **home ownership** show nearly equal distribution of last payment dates, suggesting ownership doesn't significantly influence timely payments.
